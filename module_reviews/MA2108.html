                        <h3>MA2108 Mathematical Analysis</h3>
                            <strong>Reference Textbooks:</strong> Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd edition) by Walter Rudin and Topology (2nd edition) by James Munkres.

                            <p>Seeing Rudin in the syllabus document in week 0 scared the shit out of me. I think past iterations mostly use Bartle and Sherbert, but that’s what happens after CCW takes over the mod for a sem.
                            </p>

                            <strong>Content</strong>
                            <p><ol>
                                <li> Real Numbers: field axioms, supremum/infimum property, Archimedean property, density of the rationals, triangle inequality</li>
                                <li> Sequences: convergent sequences, squeeze theorem, monotone convergence theorem, subsequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Cauchy sequences, contractive sequences, limsup, liminf</li>
                                <li> Series: Cauchy criterion for series, p-series test, comparison test, limit comparison test, ratio test, root test, Dirichlet’s test, alternating series test, absolute convergence, rearrangement of series (not tested) </li>
                                <li> Metric spaces: limits, continuity, uniform continuity, all the sequential criteria, real-valued functions: left and right limits, floor function, epsilon delta, continuous extension, intermediate value theorem, extreme value theorem </li>
                                <li> Topology: open and closed sets, subspace topology, metric space topology homeomorphisms, connectedness, Hausdorff, compactness, Heine-Borel theorem</li>
                            </ol>
                            Like CCW’s analysis, more topology was covered, which was certainly the hardest topic to grapple with (she has to constantly reassure us we will only be tested on the very basic stuff).
                            </p>

                            <strong>Lectures</strong>
                            <p>There are 2 lectures each week (lasting about 1h 40 mins), both of which are recorded. Prof Lee writes notes on her tablet but she also provides notes typed out in LaTeX before each lecture. Instead of having separate notes for each lecture, they are all in the same document, so you see updated versions of it every week. By the end, it has reached 103 pages.
                            </p>

                            <p>The lecture style follows that of a typical pure math mod – theorem, proof, rinse and repeat. Though she does inject some motivation. For example, if you have ever read Rudin, you might have encountered a proof on why \mathbb{Q} does not possess the lowest upper bound property very early on, where Rudin pulled this expression out of nowhere.
                            </p>

                            <p>After regurgitating the same argument in a lecture, she explained this can be obtained from approximating the square root of 2 using Newton-Raphson Method.
                            </p>

                            <p>Occasionally she also throws in some esoteric examples like Formal Laurent Series with Rational Coefficients and the p-adic metric being non-Archimedean so that's pretty fun too I guess. Overall, I found her lectures quite easy to follow and never felt the need to dig into Rudin and Munkres. It also helps that her handwriting is on the more legible end of math profs. This is the only math mod where I attended nearly every lecture so far lol.
                            </p>

                            <p>One advice for future students is a lot of the proofs shown in lectures aren’t tested and generally tutorials/exams won’t have you write such elaborate arguments. So, it is fine to not understand them completely – do try to follow along though (especially for those on sequences and epsilon-delta), as it builds your intuition in writing proofs.
                            </p>

 

                            <strong>Assessment</strong>
                            <p>
                            Tutorial attendance: 5% <br/>
                            Homework: 20% (4 of them) <br/>
                            Midterm: 25% <br/>
                            Final Exam: 50% <br/>
                            </p>

                            <p>The tutorials and homework assignments are pretty standard. About 7 to 9 questions per set. They definitely take longer than something like MA2104 as they are all proofs so set aside some time for them.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The midterm had 4 “long” questions (~ 10 marks each) and a true/false section (~ 16 marks), where 1 mark is awarded for true/false and 3 marks for justification. I found it quite manageable though the median was 27/50 and Prof Lee got us to submit corrections to the midterm in exchange for 5 bonus points (capped at 50 of course).
                            </p>

                            <p>1 practice paper was provided for midterm and none were provided for finals. So, I had to dig through the math library online for PYPs and boy, let me tell you they were not easy. A lot of questions rely on some sleek argument that I could never have thought of. Running out of time, I resorted to memorizing tricks since the same type of questions have reappeared before. For example, this question from 18/19 Sem 1 Final Q4a (among many others):
                            </p>

                            https://uploads.disquscdn.c...

                            <p>The trick is to rewrite the functional equation as f({x+2}/3) = f(x), define a sequence similar to the expression i.e. x_{n+1} = (x_n + 2)/3 and show it always converges to 1 regardless of the initial value. Finally apply continuity of f to show f(x) = f(1) for all real x.
                            </p>

                            <p>Anyway, that was a waste of time. I guess to compensate for the midterm, the finals had 12 marks on stating (without proof) whether a series converges/diverges and evaluating the limit of some function; and 26 marks on true/false questions. The remaining of the 60 marks paper went to short questions. She did say there was going to be short questions and true/false questions, I just didn’t expect more than half of the paper to be like that. Anyway, I didn’t really like this format? The true/false section had 13 questions (now 1 mark for correctness and 1 mark for justification), and you have to come up with a counterexample for a lot of them. But this might have helped the cohort overall I suppose.
                            </p>

                            <strong>Closing Thoughts</strong>
                            <p>I tried to give as much detail as possible above so this might not have been apparent, but I really enjoyed this mod. As painful as some of the tutorials and exams may be, the content is interesting and I don’t think they are that difficult. I didn't have to spend that much time on this mod every week (unlike some CS mods); the lectures were perfectly paced. Yeah, some ideas like uniform continuity and topology are confusing, but it will click after some YouTube videos and mulling over the notes for a few days. At the same time, stuff like metric spaces retroactively made epsilon-delta intuitive and it’s really cool seeing connectedness and compactness in action – this mod’s description states IVT and EVT as major applications. I initially found that silly as I always thought those were the most useless results ever, but I found myself actually excited seeing those pop out again in the more general setting of topological spaces.
                            </p>

                            <p>Prof Lee is one of the newer profs around but she is really good at her job; friendly to the students, prompt with uploading notes/tutorials/solutions and she is able to provide the much-needed intuition for the subject.
                            </p>
