    <h1>Merci d'Ãªtre venu</h1>
    <p>
      I am Henry, but you may call me Iota. I am a year 1 undergraduate reading Computer Science and Mathematics at National University of Singapore. My academic interest lies in both Pure Math and applying Math to CS areas like Algorithms and AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing games, watching shows, cooking and planning for my next trip. You may find out more about them, and my academic pursuits in other parts
      of this website.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be clear, this website is not at all built solely by me. A huge chunk of the code is written by my best friends ChatGPT and DeepSeek. Nevertheless,
      I've learnt a thing or two like adding "defer" when importing a JavaScript script so it works properly. I also try to implement something new
      for every page 
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation is done using a Hamburger Menu.</li>
        <li>The Math Page uses Accordion from Bootstrap.</li>
        <li>Japan 2024 uses Lightbox for the images and Parallex Scrolling for the background.</li>
        <li>China 2023 / 2024 uses a Masonry layout (like Pinterest).</li>
        <li>Media (Games and Shows) uses a Filterable Gallery.</li>
        <li>Media (Music) uses a YouTube player.</li>
      </ul>

      The downside of using AI-generated code is one cannot tell if a part of the code is redundant. So, there is usually some cleaning up to do. 
      This expository is not written by AI for the record. 

    </p>

      <!-- Dev Diary 31 Jan 2025: Integrated Music, Games and Shows and Books; Japan 2024 and China 2023 / 2024 into one page each by putting them into distinct sections and
      navigating them with <a> on the navbar. Also updated navbar to be more responsive.<br><br> -->
    <p>
      Funny Story: I spent half an hour troubleshooting the Masonry for China 2023 / 2024 when combining it with Japan into a single page because the width of the container
      was off and the images were all over the place. It went to the extent of me pulling out the old code from Github and do a one-to-one comparison. Turns out what was causing
      the issue was me enlarging my browswer view to 110% from the default 100%.
