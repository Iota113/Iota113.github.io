            <p> There seems to a general consensus that Multivariable Calculus is trivial. That, and MA1521 covering most of the content up to double integrals, gave me very little to look forward to. At first glace, this just seemed like another throwaway math mod.
            </p>
            <p> However, the second half of MA2104 was amazing. Ever felt cheated by your H2 Physics teachers’ vague explanations for what does it mean for gravity to be a conservative force? No worries – here, you learn the precise mathematical definition and properties of a conservative vector field. Indeed, vector calculus has many intriguing results. And if you’re willing to dig deeper (which I strongly encourage), you’ll stumble upon connections to topology and complex analysis. More than anything, it was a humbling experience. Although the questions themselves are straightforward, the underlying theory is immensely deep. The mod might be trivial, the subject is anything but – Multivariable Calculus the subject is excellent.
            </p>
            <p> As for Multivariable Calculus the course? Honestly, I have no idea. I skipped every lecture and tutorial as usual, partly due to me overloading this sem, partly due to me being lazy. From what I heard, Zhang De Qi is a reputable professor who knows his stuff. From my limited interactions with him from collection of midterm papers (and begging for marks – a story for another day), he seems like a nice person. It’s a pity really, I hope I’ll see him again.
            </p>
            <p> On a final note, I saw a short of someone commenting on an artist demonstrating how to draw shadows correctly. He pointed out the process of doing so is really applied geometry, and it’s a shame schools overlook this mathematical value of art. A math student also told me how art students might unironically do quite well in this mod, especially with changing the order of integration for triple integrals. Just some food for thought on how one should approach math.
