            <h1>PC1101 Frontiers of Physics</h1> 
            <p>Taken in 24/25 Sem 2<br>Lecturer: Valerio Scarani</p>
            <p>In the absence of my friend's review on NUSMods which provides some context, I feel obligated to remark here that in spite of everything I wrote,
                I enjoyed the module and I think it was decent overall. My review was written primarily for entertainment, as I felt it was a waste of time
                rehashing everything my friend mentioned in his review. Now, enjoy the ride.
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is light?</li>
                    <li>Waves in 1D, and superposition</li>
                    <li>Light waves in 3D; polarisation and diffraction</li>
                    <li>Propagation of light in media</li>
                    <li>Interferometry</li>
                    <li>History of the speed of light</li>
                    <li>A first encounter with special relativity</li>
                    <li>The quantum description of light</li>
                    <li>My first quantum phenomena</li>
                </ol>
            <p> I took this to fulfill my Cross-Disciplinary requirement and possibly as a stepping stone for Quantum Computing next time. The lectures were enjoyable. The content? It was a mess. PC1101 ambitiously attempts to cover topics from optics, special relativity and quantum physics in one semester without the necessary mathematical background. In theory, this is a bold choice. In practice, it remains a bold choice.
            </p>
            <p>Tutorials and exams felt like exercises in plugging in values and symbol pushing. It’s hard to say whether I learned physics or just got better at applying H2 Math. To its credit, the module does expose students to a wide range of topics in modern physics. I now recognize many advanced concepts by name. The knowledge is light but evenly distributed – like mie scattering.
            </p>
            <p>There’s also a notable incorporation of trivia, philosophy and history throughout. I appreciate this inclusion as it contributes to a more holistic learning experience. However, the lecture notes make no distinction between what is enrichment and what is examinable, which encourages a healthy sense of existential uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>Valerio Scarani is Italian – but more importantly, he is the one responsible for redesigning PC1101 after students complained it was trivial. From this perspective, I don't want to give him too much flak. He’s clearly invested in making physics more engaging, and under severe time constraints, has done so with a kind of elegant chaos. That is also to say, everything I've said above and everything I will say below applies specifically to Frontiers of Physics, Valerio Edition™, so you milage may vary.
            </p>
            <p>Like most students, I enjoyed Valerio's presence. He is sharp, dry, and unusually candid. He is not afraid to critique students, the system, or sometimes both at once. It’s oddly reassuring. Have you ever thought it was strange that H2 Math insists on handicapping students with Maclaurin Series, while completely ignoring the more general Taylor Series? Me neither. But Valerio has thought about it – a lot.
            </p>
            <p>All things considered, this module isn’t particularly difficult. The math involved is primarily secondary school algebra with some complex numbers. Do not let the complicated-looking equations with 7 constants deceive you. As Valerio aptly puts it, it’s there for culture. And in that sense, the module is very cultured.
            </p>
            <p>For the math-inclined, you’ll encounter terms like complex inner products and conformal groups. But, in true PC1101 fashion, you won’t learn much about them.
